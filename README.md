Creating a new Telegram bot using asyncio and aiogram ðŸ˜Ž

This Telegram bot, built with the Aiogram library for Python, offers an array of features:

**Cat Pictures**: Enjoy adorable pictures of cats on request.

**Text Samples**: Get interesting text samples or quotes whenever you want.

However, the bot is still a work in progress, with more features in the pipeline:

**Weather Forecasts**: Get weather updates for any location, 
including pressure readings indicating whether it's low, normal, or high. 
Humidity data will be added in the future.

**Basic Calculations**: Perform simple mathematical operations like 
addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction directly in the chat.

**Interactive Games**: Play games such as Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) and more for a fun time within the chat.

**Memes and Stickers**: Request memes and stickers for a dose of humor.

Feel free to interact with the bot and explore its current functionalities. 
Stay tuned for exciting updates and new features as we continue to enhance its capabilities!
